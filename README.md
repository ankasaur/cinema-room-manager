# cinema-room-manager
Cinema Room Manager is a project completed while studying in JetBrains Academy. 
Its main purpose is to help cinemas to create a matrix of seating arrangement for each room, manage reservations and keep financial records and stats.

### There is no GUI for now

This project implements a cinema reservation system, which allows users to reserve a selected seat. 
The system keeps track of previous reservations while is being run, therefore it does not allow to book the same seat twice.
There are also different prices for the seats depending on the row (front rows are cheaper).
